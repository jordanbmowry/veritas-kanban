**Goal:** Establish systematic A/B testing across both platforms to continuously improve conversion rates.
**Owner:** Mark (execution) + Brad (analysis)
**Effort:** S (4-6 hours setup, then ongoing)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A/B testing plan documented: what to test, in what order, sample sizes, success criteria
- First A/B tests running: Email 1 subject line on each cold sequence variant + newsletter subject line
- Monthly optimization review scheduled (first Monday of month)
- Win/loss review process documented and first review completed

**Subtasks:**

1. Document A/B testing priority order: (1) Subject lines, (2) Preview text, (3) CTA wording, (4) Send day/time, (5) Long vs short copy, (6) Content type as primary value — one variable at a time (1h) — Ref: Customer.io Guide §8, A/B Testing Strategy
2. Set up first A/B test: Email 1 subject line on HubSpot Cold AI sequence (2 variants, 20% test → winner to 80%), same for newsletter Issue #2 in Customer.io (1h)
3. Create win/loss review template — questions for won deals (Why we won, what we did well, expansion opportunity) and lost deals (Why we lost, what we'd do differently, stay in touch?) — schedule first review (2h) — Ref: HubSpot Guide §9, Win/Loss Review Process
4. Schedule monthly optimization review: sequence performance vs benchmarks (Open 25-35%, Reply 5-10%, Meeting 2-4%), identify worst performers for revision, update content quarterly (1h) — Ref: HubSpot Guide §8, Reporting Cadence + Customer.io Guide §8, Reporting Cadence
5. Build quarterly list hygiene process: remove hard bounces, clean unsubscribes, sunset unengaged, review ICP targeting (1h) — Ref: HubSpot Guide §2, Data Hygiene + Customer.io Guide §7, Sunset Policy

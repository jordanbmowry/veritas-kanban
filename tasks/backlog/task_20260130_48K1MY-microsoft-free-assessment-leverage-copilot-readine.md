**Goal:** Leverage Microsoft free assessment programs as lead gen and credibility tools — NOT pursuing Solutions Partner (too early with current headcount).

**Owner:** CEO (Brad) — MS relationship; CTO (Robert) — technical delivery
**Effort:** M
**Dependencies:** None

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Digital Meld registered to deliver Copilot Readiness Assessments
- Digital Meld registered to deliver Cloud Security Assessments
- Assessment landing pages live on digitalmeld.io
- First assessment delivered to a client or prospect

**Subtasks:**

1. Research Microsoft Copilot Readiness Assessment program — requirements, deliverables, how to register as a delivery partner (3h)
2. Research Microsoft Cloud Security Assessment program — same (3h)
3. Create assessment offering pages on digitalmeld.io — position as free/low-cost entry point for prospects (4h)
4. Draft outreach email for existing contacts — offer free assessment as relationship builder (2h)
5. Deliver first assessment to a pilot client — document the process for repeatable delivery (4h)

**Note:** Solutions Partner deferred until team grows. Free assessments require no certifications and serve as excellent land-and-expand tools.

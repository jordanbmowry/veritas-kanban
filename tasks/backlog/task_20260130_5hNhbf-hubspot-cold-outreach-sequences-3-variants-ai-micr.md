**Goal:** Build 3 cold outreach sequences in HubSpot — 7 emails each over 21 days — ready for Mark and Brandy to enroll contacts.

**Effort:** L (10-14 hours)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 3 sequences live: 'Cold Outreach - AI/Automation', 'Cold Outreach - Microsoft Cloud', 'Cold Outreach - Security/Compliance'
- Each sequence: 7 emails (Pattern Interrupt → Case Study → Industry Insight → Free Assessment → Content Share → Direct Ask → Breakup)
- Unenrollment triggers set: reply, meeting booked, unsubscribe, deal created
- Personalization tokens configured (firstname, company, industry, owner name, meeting link)
- Send times set: Tue-Thu, 8-10 AM local time

2. Build Variant B: Microsoft Cloud Focus — 7 emails (security risk hook → license savings case study → Copilot insight → free audit → checklist → direct ask → breakup) (3h) — Ref: HubSpot Guide §4, Variant B
3. Build Variant C: Security/Compliance Focus — 7 emails (CMMC urgency → CMMC case study → common mistakes → free gap analysis → checklist → deadline urgency → breakup) (3h) — Ref: HubSpot Guide §4, Variant C
